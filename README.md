# HR-Data-Analysis

This project involves data analysis using Python's pandas library to manipulate and explore data. The project also includes data downloading and merging from various sources.

## Project Overview

The project's main goal is to analyze and gain insights from multiple datasets, including office data and HR data. The datasets are acquired from online sources, and then they are processed and analyzed to answer specific questions.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- requests

## Data Analysis

The data analysis involves several stages:

1. **Merging Data**: Merging office data from two different sources (A and B) with HR data based on employee IDs.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Checking the index and column names of the merged dataset.
    - Sorting and filtering the data to answer specific questions.
    - Calculating statistics and aggregations.

3. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the data using plots and charts to gain insights.

4. **Results and Conclusions**: Providing answers to specific questions based on the analysis.

## Questions Answered

1. What are the top 10 departments with the highest average monthly hours?
2. How many projects are assigned to employees with low salaries in the IT department?
3. What are the `last_evaluation` and `satisfaction_level` values for specific employees?
4. What are the statistics related to the number of projects, time spent at the company, work accidents, and evaluation scores for employees who left and those who stayed?
5. How does the median of average monthly hours vary across different departments and salary levels?
6. What is the satisfaction level and last evaluation of employees with different time spent at the company and promotion statuses?
